# Great Bay

## Addons:

- Create a sign up and login system that prompts users for a username and password upon loading up the app. **Do not worry about setting up a truly secure database if you choose to tackle this addon. Just worry about building working sign up and login features.**

- Create a system on the "POST AN ITEM" which allows users to look at the auctions they have created. On this screen they can add new auctions, modify previous auctions, or close bidding on an auction.

- Create a system which allows users to view all of the auctions of which they are the leading bidder.

- Create a third option on the main screen which allows administrators to modify the database as they see fit.

- Create visually appealing tables. This means making dynamic console code and it is a lot harder than it might seem at first so do not think this one is so simple.

- Create a search function that allows users to look through the database of available auctions to find those that share the specified keyword or username.
